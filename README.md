# Infix-to-Postfix
This is a lightweight infix to postfix project developed in Java. 
My code provides an evaluation and processing of the mathematical expressions.
The converteremploys a stack-based algorithm, utilizing operator precedence and associativity rules
to transform the input infix expression into its postfix equivalent.
The resulting postfix expression maintains the correct order of operations, ensuring accurate evaluation.
